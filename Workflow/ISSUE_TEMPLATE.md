# Questions regarding how to use OWMP

We want to keep signal strong in the GitHub issue tracker â€“ to make sure that it remains the best place to track bugs and features that affect development.

If you have a question on how to use OWMP, please [post it to Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=OWMP) with the tag [#OWMP](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/OWMP).

Please do not post general questions directly as GitHub issues. They may sit for weeks unanswered, or may be spontaneously closed without answer.

# Reporting issues with OWMP Dashboard

Before filing a new issue, make sure an issue for your problem doesn't already exist.

The best way to get a bug fixed is to provide a _pull request_ with a simplified failing test case (or better yet, include a fix).

# Feature requests

To discuss new features which are not OWMP. specific and fundamentally change the way OWMP works, open an issue against the specification.
